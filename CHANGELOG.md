# @ttab/textbit-plugins

## 1.7.0-beta.3

### Patch Changes

- dependencies updates:
    - Updated dependency [`slate@^0.126.2` ↗︎](https://www.npmjs.com/package/slate/v/0.126.2) (from `^0.124.1`, in `peerDependencies`)
    - Updated dependency [`slate-react@^0.126.4` ↗︎](https://www.npmjs.com/package/slate-react/v/0.126.4) (from `^0.125.1`, in `peerDependencies`)

## 1.7.0-beta.2

### Patch Changes

- Moves the package's repository link on GitHub Packages to the monorepo. The manifest already names it; a publish is what makes the registry act on it, and publish permission follows that link.

## 1.7.0-beta.0

### Minor Changes

- Empty links are removed rather than left behind, parseImageId no longer has a default export, and the package carries the MIT license text its manifest always claimed. It now depends on a @ttab/textbit range instead of an exact version, so consumers do not end up with two copies, and its slate-react peer moves to ^0.125.1 to match textbit.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies:
  - @ttab/textbit@1.7.0-beta.0
